# Binary-encoding-and-decoding


This project has multiple projects in one. The first part is a simple ASCII to binary encoder using Python, formatting the encoded message into a 8-bit format per character. 

The second part of this project is dedicated to sound encoding. This code is meant to generate an audio-file based off of a binary code and is intended for educational and experimenting purposes.
