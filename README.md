# Binary-encoding-and-decoding


This project has multiple projects in one. The first part is a simple ASCII to binary encoder using Python, formatting the encoded message into a 8-bit format per character. 

The second part of this project is dedicated to sound encoding. This code is meant to generate an audio-file based off of a binary code and is intended for educational and experimenting purposes. It also has a small decoding function to be able to see if the messages are encoded correctly, as well as serving as a basic base for learning decryptiong algorithms. 

The codes are commented for better understanding, but I recommend to look at the simple binary encoding and decoding part before analyzing the audio section, as the first part of both is exactly the same.
